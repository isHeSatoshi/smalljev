# JevBench v1.2.1 — results

**JevBench Score** = Intelligence, Calibration, Speed, Cost — 25 % each, geometric mean: a weak axis pulls the score down hard.

Jev 1.13.0 is #1 with 75.3; SemIf (Qwen3.5-4B) is #2, 0.7 points behind (difference of the rounded scores).

**Partial runs** — shown, not ranked (a tier attempted for fewer than 95 % of its decisions):

| # | System | **JevBench Score** | Intelligence | Calibration | Speed | Cost | $ / 1,000 | p50 raw → adjusted | Endpoint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  | Qwen3.8 27B (partial run) | **25.5** | 74.6 | 92.1 | 61.3 | 0.0 | $2.7110 est. | 5.75 s | Chutes shared inference (TEE) |
|  | Needle 3, options as tools (partial run) | **19.1** | 39.5 | none (label only) | 52.8 | 63.7 | $0.0162 est. | 3.78 s → 7.71 s | our CPU (2 threads, Ryzen 5 3600) |

Footnote — djev: Hosted API in free preview: the cost uses djev's announced price ($0.035 per million input tokens, output free); nothing is charged yet. Open-sourcing is planned, not yet released. Probabilities are djev's own (its docs call them experimental and uncalibrated).

Footnote — open-alternative-jev: With the options in reverse order (A. no, B. yes) the same model scored 21 % instead of 72 % on yes/no answer-judging items — small models are very sensitive to option order. The ranked row uses the author's own order
(`A. yes, B. no`, as his `yes_no()` helper builds it); the reversed-order run was our adapter's mistake and is kept only as raw
files (`results/v1.2/wip/`, GPU round runs).

## How the score works

| Axis | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Intelligence** | 100 x weighted accuracy: hard 30 %, easy 14 %, standard 28 %, judge 28 %. Accuracy = correct / all items; failed, timed-out or unparseable answers count as wrong. |
| **Calibration** | Hard tier only, systems that return a probability distribution: mean of (a) 100 x (1 - ECE/0.5), ECE = top-label expected calibration error in 10 bins, and (b) probability fidelity = 100 x (1 - mean total-variation distance) between the returned distribution and the exact gold distribution on the 20 probability items. Label-only systems have none; it counts as 0 in the JevBench Score. |
| **Speed** | Mean of score(p50) and score(p95) of the serial 242-decision standard+judge run; score(s) = 100 - 20 log10(s / 0.1 s), clipped to 0..100 (0.1 s = 100, 1 s = 80, 10 s = 60). Latency of self-hosted and demo endpoints is adjusted ×2 (+0.15 s on our own servers) to approximate production load — an assumption, not a measurement; raw measurements are in the table and the repo. Production APIs (Jev, djev, OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek, Chutes) are not adjusted. |
| **Cost** | Dollars per 1,000 decisions pooled over all 534 v1.2 decisions; score = 100 - 30 log10(usd / 0.001), clipped to 0..100 ($0.001 = 100, $0.01 = 70, $0.10 = 40, $1 = 10). Measured = public tariff x measured tokens. est. = hosted-provider list price of the same weights or size class x tokens. announced = the provider's published price, not yet charged (free preview), x measured tokens. |
| **JevBench Score** | exp(sum over the four axes of 0.25 x ln(max(axis, 1))) — the geometric mean of Intelligence, Calibration, Speed and Cost. A weak axis pulls the score down hard; a strong axis cannot buy it back. |

## Other views (not the JevBench Score)

Other views reweight the same four axes and combine them the same way (geometric mean). They are not the JevBench Score. Weights are Intelligence : Calibration : Speed : Cost.

## Hard tier

![Calibration](results/v1.2/charts/calibration.png)

220 new decisions (111 public, 109 held out): long multi-condition policy documents (2-6k tokens), priority trade-offs, deliberately ambiguous cases with a 'no clear answer' label, traps, multi-hop lookups, date/number reasoning, adversarial distractors, subtle answer-judging, overlapping routing, and probability items with an exact gold distribution. Half written by Claude Opus 5, half by GPT-5.6 Sol; each item reviewed blind and then against its gold by the other model; one discussion round; frozen and hashed before any benchmarked system saw an item. No item was selected on any system's answers.

## Revision log

- **v1.2.1** (2026-09-19): Added djev (Maisa, diffusion-gemma): full v1.2 set (534 decisions incl. held-out) through its production API, scored with the unchanged v1.2 rules. Cost at djev's announced price ($0.035/M input tokens, output free), which is not yet charged (free preview). No other row changed.
- **v1.2** (2026-09-19): Final JevBench Score: 4 axes, geometric mean.

## What changed from v1.2-wip

- Score: four axes (Intelligence, Calibration, Speed, Cost), 25 % each, geometric mean — replaces the Balanced 33:33:33 arithmetic Main Score.
- Intelligence weights hard 30 % (was 50 %); the rest 1 : 2 : 2 over easy : standard : judge.
- Speed scale 20 points per 10× (was 50); Cost scale 30 points per 10× from $0.001 (was 25). Latency of non-production endpoints adjusted (assumption, see the speed note).
- One open-alternative-jev row (author's option order), named plainly; the reversed-order run is a footnote.
- Needle 3 options-as-tools priced on Needle 3's per-token basis ($0.0162 est.; it had no price).
- Qwen3.8 27B on Chutes is treated as a production API (no latency adjustment).
